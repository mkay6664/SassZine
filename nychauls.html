              <h4 class="subheading">Urban markets filled with several artisan food vendors (“food halls”) are emerging in prime locations in Manhattan. Food halls are replacing large swaths of real estate once reserved for high-end retailers. Their popularity has marked a shift in the tastes and preferences of City dwellers, as all generations of NYC eaters flock to grab a bite at lunch hour in one of the new food halls nearby.</h4>

              <p>New York | Food trucks are driving away in droves to make way for foot traffic into the City’s hip new food halls. Over the past 10 years, food halls have silently emerged all over the City, and they are expected to explode in popularity and number in the years to come. With Eataly widely considered the first to market for the food hall trend, more recent concepts by UrbanSpace and Bell Market have demonstrated that these delicious brick and mortar food bazaars are here to both stay and please.</p>

              <p>Cushman and Wakefield, a leading global commercial real estate firm, reported that by the end of 2017 there were approximately 118 food halls in the U.S. The number grew by 70% in just a two year period. New York City is the proud home to nearly 30 active food halls. </p>

              <p>Phil Colicchio, a Managing Partner at Colicchio Consulting, noted: </p>

              <p class="quote">"Food Halls are definitely a powerful movement; they are here to stay and for good reason. Food halls not only appeal to our inherent craving for variety, they also enjoy an inherent practical advantage over both food trucks and standalone restaurants. If a restaurant or a food truck struggles, it closes. If one or two vendors in a food hall struggle, a venue operator can work with them to modify their programs or change them out without disrupting the whole operation…. that’s the primary reason why we haven’t seen too many food halls fail."</p>

              <p>The growth of food halls is similar to that of gourmet food trucks, which first appeared after the Great Recession. Now a decade later with rising gas prices, new regulations impacting operators of truck vendors, and hard to please diners looking for a place to sit down and devour their ramen, taco, and/or pizza, consumers in the City shifted their attention and lunch budget to food halls.</p>
